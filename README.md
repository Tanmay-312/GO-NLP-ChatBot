# GoLang NLP ChatBot

## Overview

This project is a GoLang-based NLP ChatBot integrated with Slack API, WIT.ai, and Wolfram API. The ChatBot leverages natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries on Slack, utilizing external APIs for enhanced functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [GoLang](https://golang.org/)
- [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/)
- [WIT.ai API](https://wit.ai/)
- [Wolfram API](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanmay-312/GO-NLP-ChatBot.git
   cd GO-NLP-ChatBot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for APIs (Slack, WIT.ai, Wolfram) in `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   SLACK_API_TOKEN=your_slack_api_token
   WIT_AI_TOKEN=your_wit_ai_token
   WOLFRAM_APP_ID=your_wolfram_app_id
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the GoLang server:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

2. Integrate the Slack bot with your workspace using the provided Slack API token.

3. Interact with the bot on Slack by sending messages and receiving responses based on NLP queries handled by WIT.ai and additional information retrieved from Wolfram API.

## Technologies

- **GoLang**: A statically typed, compiled programming language used for backend development.
- **Slack API**: Provides methods for interacting with Slack workspaces and integrating bots.
- **WIT.ai**: Natural language processing platform for understanding user inputs.
- **Wolfram API**: Accesses Wolfram's computational knowledge engine for retrieving information based on queries.

## Features

- **NLP Integration**: Utilizes WIT.ai for understanding natural language queries.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with Wolfram API to fetch relevant information based on user queries.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Provides real-time responses on Slack based on user messages.
- **Scalability**: Built in GoLang for efficient performance and scalability.
